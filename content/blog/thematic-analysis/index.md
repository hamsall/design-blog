title: "Thematic analysis: data wrangling in design"

description: "Thematic analysis is a way to understand qualitative data quantitatively, especially when there’s lots of it. It works by interpreting meaning from individual data points called fragments to create themes. According to Clarke and Braun, the method is unusual because it is ‘unbounded by theoretical commitment’."
